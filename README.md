# Hangman-Game

I made the Hangman game using WPF (structured on MVVM and using Data Binding)

The main page looks like this:

The game gives you the opportunity to add players:

To enter the game you must select a player from the list of players:

The game gives you the opportunity to choose from several categories to guess words. The game will always open on all categories.

In 30 seconds you have to guess the word. If time runs out you lose the game.

You can miss the letter of the word up to 5 times. At the 6th mistake you will lose the game.

__The game will be won when 5 consecutive words from the same category are guessed.__

In the File menu you can see how many games you have played, how many you have lost and how many you have won. You still have the option to save a game and continue it later.
